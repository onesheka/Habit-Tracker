# Habit-Tracker

To track the hours a student studies and hours he/she uses phone(you can count other non-productive hours here) <br>

It creates 4 tables in the database:<br>
- Working Day - Normal Regular College Day
- Weekend - No need to explain that
- Holiday - say October 2 (no tak to do but you got a day off)
- Prior Engagement - say it's your friend's birthday so you don't have that much time to complete your work tasks. 

You can keep a track of your daily habits here, maybe analyse on the monthly basis using numpy and pandas. Maybe visualize them to improve  progress using matplotlib/seaborn. <br>

Ok Bye. <br>
